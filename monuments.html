        <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
          <p id="eiffel">The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris. It is named after the engineer
            Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. The tower is 33o metres tall, about the same height as
            an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres on each side.
            The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level´s upper
            platform is 276m above the ground.
            The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers working
            for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. Initially showed little enthusiasme, but he did approve further study,
            and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company´s architectual department, to contribute
            to the design.

        <h2>Notre-Dame de Paris</h2>
          <p id="notre-dame">Notre-Dame de Paris is a medieval CAtholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité, in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. It
            is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Several of its attributes set it apart from
            the earlier Romanesque style, particulary its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous
            colorful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration. Construction of the cathedral
            began in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely completed by 1260, though it
            was modified frequently in the centuries that followed. The cathedral is one of the most widely recognized symbols
            of the city of Paris and the French nation. In 1805, it was
            awarded the honorary status of a minor basilica. As the cathedral of the archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains
            the
            cathedra of the archbishop of Paris (Laurent Ulrich).</p>

      <h2>Louvre</h2>
      <p id="louvre">The Louvre is the world`s most-visited museum, and a historic landmark in Paris. It is the home of some of the
        best-known works of art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. A central landmark
        of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). At
        any
        given point in time, approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are being exhibited over an
        area
        of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet). Attendance in 2021 was 2.8 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic, up
        five
        percent from 2020, but far below pre-COVID attendance. Nonetheless, the Louvre still topped the list of
        most-visited
        art museums in the world in 2021.
        The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II.
        Remnants
        of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress
        eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French
        Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the
        Palace of
        Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including,
        from
        1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des
        Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of
        a
        series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National
        Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.
