    The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[27][28] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became an important trading centre.[29] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for that purpose.[30]
